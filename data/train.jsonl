However, you must: (1) justify your DOE design (factorial design, response surface methodology, etc.), (2) demonstrate that critical process parameters are identified and controlled, (3) show that the design space is well-characterized, and (4) include appropriate acceptance criteria and statistical analysis. Your validation protocol must be approved before execution, and your validation report must demonstrate that the process consistently produces product meeting predetermined specifications."}]}

Misleading: Verification testing doesn't constitute clinical proof.</think>No, this would be misleading. **'Clinically proven'** implies evidence from clinical use in patients. **Design verification testing** (bench testing, simulated use) does not constitute clinical proof. [cite_start]Under **21 CFR 801.5**, device labeling must not be misleading[cite: 8015]. FTC also enforces truth-in-advertising standards. **What constitutes 'clinical' evidence:** (1) Clinical studies/trials in human subjects, (2) Published clinical literature, (3) Post-market clinical follow-up data, (4) Real-world evidence from clinical use. **Verification testing:** (1) Bench testing of performance specifications, (2) Simulated use testing, (3) Engineering studies. **Appropriate claims based on verification:** (1) 'Demonstrated through performance testing to meet [specific parameter],' (2) 'Validated for [specific performance claim],' (3) 'Tested to [standard] requirements.' If you want to claim 'clinically proven,' you must have actual clinical data. Otherwise, use accurate terminology that reflects your testing basis. False or misleading claims can result in FDA warning letters, FTC enforcement, and legal liability."}]}

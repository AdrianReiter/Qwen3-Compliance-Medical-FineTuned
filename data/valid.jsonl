[cite_start]Under **IEC 62304 Clause 4.3**, software items inherit the safety classification of the system (in this case, **Class C**) unless you document a rationale for why they are independent[cite: 3114]. If the UI runs on the same processor without mechanisms like memory protection or time partitioning to prevent it from interfering with the control algorithm, the UI must also be classified as **Class C**."}]}

You must document this evaluation in the Risk Management File. If the crash could lead to an unacceptable risk (e.g., interruption of therapy), you must implement **Risk Control Measures** (e.g., a watchdog timer) to mitigate it."}]}

Inherent safety by design (e.g., lower voltage).\n2. Protective measures (e.g., insulation, fuses, interlocks).\n3.
